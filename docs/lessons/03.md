# 3. Loops and arrays: part one

## 3.1. The `while` loop

Solve the task using `while` loop:

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | Create two integer-type variables, `c` and `d`. Decrease `c` by `2` and increase `d` by `10` every cycle as long as `c` is greater than `-500` and `d` is less than `10000`.         |
| 2       | Create two integer-type variables, `a` and `b`. Increase `a` by `3` and decrease `b` by `1` every cycle as long as `a` is less than `300` and `b` is greater than `5`.               |
| 3       | Create two float-point variables `k` and `x`. Increase `x` by `1` every cycle as long as `k / x` is greater than `0.5`. 
| 4       | Create integer-type variable `j`. Increase `j` by `1` every cycle as long as the remainder of the division of `j` by `216` is less than `121`. 
| 5       | Create three integer-type variables, `a`, `b` and `c`. Increase `a` by `1`, `b` by `2` and decrease `c` by `3` every cycle as long as `a + b` is less than `c`. 
| 6       | Create integer-type variable `i`. Increase `i` by `1` every cycle as long as the remainder of the division of `i` by `30` is not zero.                                         |
| 7       | Create two float-point variables `t` and `e`. Increase `e` by `3` every cycle as long as `1 / e` is greater than `t`. 
| 8       | Create two integer-type variables, `g` and `h`. Decrease `g` by `4` times and increase `h` by `2` times every cycle as long as `g` is greater than `-2` and `h` is less than `2560`. |
| 9       | Create two integer-type variables, `e` and `f`. Increase `e` by `2` times and decrease `f` by `3` times every cycle as long as `e` is less than `670` and `f` is greater than `-30`. |                                |

You can initialize variables either by integer constant in code or by reading data from a standard input.

### Reference (3.1)

Syntax of the `while` loop:

```c
while (expression)
{
  statement;
}
```

Firstly, the `expression` is evaluated. If it is `true` (non-zero), `statement` is executed and `expression` is re-evaluated. This cycle contiinues until `expression` becomes `false` (zero), at which point execution resumes after `statement`.

## 3.2. The `for` loop

Solve the task using `for` loop:

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Print all integer numbers from `100` to `300`, for which the remainder of the division by `5` equals to `3` or `4`.  |
| 2       | Print all odd integer numbers from `300` to `500`.
| 3       | Print all integer numbers from `50` to `100`, for which the remainder of the division by `9` is greater than `2` and less than `7`.   |
| 4       | Print all integer numbers from `-500` to `-200`, for which the remainder of the division by `8` equals to `-5`.                           |
| 5       | Print all integer numbers from `10` to `90`, which are divisible of `3`   |
| 6       | Print all integer numbers from `-100` to `100`, for which the remainder of the division by `5` equals to `3` or `-3`.                            |
| 7       | Print all integer numbers from `100` to `300`, for which the remainder of the division by `13` is greater than `3` and less than `8`. |
| 8       | Print all even integer numbers from `1` to `1000`.                                                                                    |
| 9       | Print all integer numbers from `0` to `100`, which ends with digits `1` and `3`  |

### Reference (3.2)

Syntax of the `for` loop:

```c
for (expression1; expression2; expression3)
{
  statement;
}
```

This `for` loop is equivalent to `while` loop shown below:

```c
expression1;
while (expression2)
{
  statement;
  expression3;
}
```

So, the `for` loop is a generalization of the `while` loop.

The first part of the loop, `expression1`, is the initialization. The second part, `expression2`, is the test or condition tha controls the loop (the same as for `while` loop). This condition is evaluated. If it is `true` (non-zero), the body  of the loop is executed. Then the increment step, `expression3`, is executed, and the condition re-evaluated. The loop terminates id the condition has become `false` (zero).

## 3.3. The `do-while` loop

Solve the task using `do-while` loop. Ask user to repeatedly input integer numbers. Terminate the loop ...

| Variant | Description                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... if the current entered number is negative             |
| 2       | ... if the current entered number is even.                                      |
| 3       | ... when the multiplication of all entered numbers becomes greater than `4000`. |
| 4       | ... if the current entered number is greater than `100`.                        |
| 5       | ... when the count of all entered numbers becomes greater than `5`.             |
| 6       | ... if the current entered number is odd.                                       |
| 7       | ... when the sum of all entered numbers becomes greater than `100`.             |
| 8       | ... if the current entered number is less than previous one.             |
| 9       | ... if the current entered number is divisible of `5`             |

### Reference (3.3)

The `while` and `for` loops test the termination condition at the top. By contrast, `do-while` loop, tests at the bottom after making each pass through the loop body. **The body is executed at least once.**

Syntax of the `do-while` loop:

```c
do
{
  statement;
}
while (expression);
```

The `statement` is executed, then `expression` is evaluated. If it's `true` (non-zero), `statement` is evaluated again, and so on. When the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.

## 3.4. Arrays

Declare an array of `10` integer-typed values. Initialize it using the `while` loop. The array must contain ...

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... numbers which are divisible of 7, starting from 7 (`7`, `14`, `21`, ...) |
| 2       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `7` equals `4`, starting from `4` onwards (`4`, `11`, `18`, ...).                                 |
| 3       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `26` is greater than `14` and less than `18`, starting from `41` onwards (`41`, `42`, `43`, ...). |
| 4       | ... numbers which are end with digits `2` and `7`, starting from `12` (`12`, `17`, `22`, ...) |
| 5       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `13` equals `7`, starting from `7` onwards (`7`, `20`, `33`, ...).                                |
| 6       | ... numbers which are divisible of 4, starting from 4 (`4`, `8`, `12` ...) |
| 7       | ... odd numbers starting from `1` onwards (`1`, `3`, `5`, ...).                                                                                          |
| 8       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `15` is greater than `2` and less than `6`, starting from `48` onwards (`48`, `49`, `50`, ...).   |
| 9       | ... even numbers starting from `2` onwards (`2`, `4`, `6`, ...).                                                                                         |

Print the array to the standard output using the `for` loop.

### Reference (3.4)

To declare an array one should use a square brackets. Number in the square brackets means the size of the array:

```c
int numbers[10]; // Non-initialized array of 10 integer-typed values.
char symbols[3]; // Non-initialized array of 3 char-typed values.
```

Arrays can be created and initialized in one line using a braces:

```c
double values[3] = { 1.21, 1.44, 1.69 }; // Initialized array of 3 double-typed values.
```

This statement can be rewritten without mentioning the size of the array. In this case, the size is adjusted according to the number of elements initialized within the array:

```c
double values[] = { 1.21, 1.44, 1.69 }; // Initialized array of 3 double-typed values.
```

Note that the number in square brackets must be no less than the number of initial values. If it is larger, then uninitialized elements remain in the array.

## 3.5. The `break` statement

Declare an array of `10` integer-typed values. Initialize it either by integer constants in code or by reading data from a standard input. Using the `for` loop, try to find in the array a number ...

| Variant | Description                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... is divisible of `5`   |
| 2       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `18` is greater than `4` and less than `7`.   |
| 3       | ... ends with digit `3`  |
| 4       | ... is greater than `13` and less than `17`.                                                 |
| 5       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `9` equals `4`.                               |
| 6       | ... has at least `2` digits   |
| 7       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `6` equals `5`.                               |
| 8       | ... is greater than `40` and less than `46`.                                                 |
| 9       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `31` is greater than `16` and less than `21`. |

If the required number was found, display it. Otherwise, display a message saying that the number was not found.

Use the `break` statement to terminate `for` loop once the required number was found.

Sample output:

```
Please, input the array: 4 -3 5 8 -1 4 2 0 5 6
Required number: 8
```

### Reference (3.5)

It is sometimes convenient to be able to exit from a loop other than by testing at the top or bottom. The break statement provides an early exit from `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, just as from `switch`. A break causes the innermost enclosing loop or `switch` to be exited immediately.

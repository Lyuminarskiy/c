# 3. Loops and arrays: part one

## 3.1. The `while` loop

Solve the task using `while` loop:

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | Create two integer-type variables, `c` and `d`. Decrease `c` by `2` and increase `d` by `10` every cycle as long as `c` is greater than `-500` and `d` is less than `10000`.         |
| 2       | Create two integer-type variables, `a` and `b`. Increase `a` by `3` and decrease `b` by `1` every cycle as long as `a` is less than `300` and `b` is greater than `5`.               |
| 3       | Create two float-point variables `k` and `x`. Increase `x` by `1` every cycle as long as `k / x` is greater than `0.5`. 
| 4       | Create integer-type variable `j`. Increase `j` by `1` every cycle as long as the remainder of the division of `j` by `216` is less than `121`. 
| 5       | Create three integer-type variables, `a`, `b` and `c`. Increase `a` by `1`, `b` by `2` and decrease `c` by `3` every cycle as long as `a + b` is less than `c`. 
| 6       | Create integer-type variable `i`. Increase `i` by `1` every cycle as long as the remainder of the division of `i` by `30` is not zero.                                         |
| 7       | Create two float-point variables `t` and `e`. Increase `e` by `3` every cycle as long as `1 / e` is greater than `t`. 
| 8       | Create two integer-type variables, `g` and `h`. Decrease `g` by `4` times and increase `h` by `2` times every cycle as long as `g` is greater than `-2` and `h` is less than `2560`. |
| 9       | Create two integer-type variables, `e` and `f`. Increase `e` by `2` times and decrease `f` by `3` times every cycle as long as `e` is less than `670` and `f` is greater than `-30`. |                                |

You can initialize variables either by integer constant in code or by reading data from a standard input.

### Reference (3.1)

Syntax of the `while` loop:

```c
while (expression)
{
  statement;
}
```

Firstly, the `expression` is evaluated. If it is `true` (non-zero), `statement` is executed and `expression` is re-evaluated. This cycle contiinues until `expression` becomes `false` (zero), at which point execution resumes after `statement`.

## 3.2. The `for` loop

Solve the task using `for` loop:

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Print all integer numbers from `100` to `300`, for which the remainder of the division by `5` equals to `3` or `4`.  |
| 2       | Print all odd integer numbers from `300` to `500`.
| 3       | Print all integer numbers from `50` to `100`, for which the remainder of the division by `9` is greater than `2` and less than `7`.   |
| 4       | Print all integer numbers from `-500` to `-200`, for which the remainder of the division by `8` equals to `-5`.                           |
| 5       | Print all integer numbers from `10` to `90`, which are divisible of `3`   |
| 6       | Print all integer numbers from `-100` to `100`, for which the remainder of the division by `5` equals to `3` or `-3`.                            |
| 7       | Print all integer numbers from `100` to `300`, for which the remainder of the division by `13` is greater than `3` and less than `8`. |
| 8       | Print all even integer numbers from `1` to `1000`.                                                                                    |
| 9       | Print all integer numbers from `0` to `100`, which ends with digits `1` and `3`  |

### Reference (3.2)

Syntax of the `for` loop:

```c
for (expression1; expression2; expression3)
{
  statement;
}
```

This `for` loop is equivalent to `while` loop shown below:

```c
expression1;
while (expression2)
{
  statement;
  expression3;
}
```

So, the `for` loop is a generalization of the `while` loop.

The first part of the loop, `expression1`, is the initialization. The second part, `expression2`, is the test or condition tha controls the loop (the same as for `while` loop). This condition is evaluated. If it is `true` (non-zero), the body  of the loop is executed. Then the increment step, `expression3`, is executed, and the condition re-evaluated. The loop terminates id the condition has become `false` (zero).

## 3.3. The `do-while` loop

Solve the task using `do-while` loop. Ask user to repeatedly input integer numbers. Terminate the loop ...

| Variant | Description                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... if the current entered number is negative             |
| 2       | ... if the current entered number is even.                                      |
| 3       | ... when the multiplication of all entered numbers becomes greater than `4000`. |
| 4       | ... if the current entered number is greater than `100`.                        |
| 5       | ... when the count of all entered numbers becomes greater than `5`.             |
| 6       | ... if the current entered number is odd.                                       |
| 7       | ... when the sum of all entered numbers becomes greater than `100`.             |
| 8       | ... if the current entered number is less than previous one.             |
| 9       | ... if the current entered number is divisible of `5`             |

### Reference (3.3)

The `while` and `for` loops test the termination condition at the top. By contrast, `do-while` loop, tests at the bottom after making each pass through the loop body. **The body is executed at least once.**

Syntax of the `do-while` loop:

```c
do
{
  statement;
}
while (expression);
```

The `statement` is executed, then `expression` is evaluated. If it's `true` (non-zero), `statement` is evaluated again, and so on. When the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.

## 3.4. Arrays

Declare an array of `10` integer-typed values. Initialize it using the `while` loop. The array must contain ...

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... numbers which are divisible of 7, starting from 7 (`7`, `14`, `21`, ...) |
| 2       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `7` equals `4`, starting from `4` onwards (`4`, `11`, `18`, ...).                                 |
| 3       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `26` is greater than `14` and less than `18`, starting from `41` onwards (`41`, `42`, `43`, ...). |
| 4       | ... numbers which are end with digits `2` and `7`, starting from `12` (`12`, `17`, `22`, ...) |
| 5       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `13` equals `7`, starting from `7` onwards (`7`, `20`, `33`, ...).                                |
| 6       | ... numbers which are divisible of 4, starting from 4 (`4`, `8`, `12` ...) |
| 7       | ... odd numbers starting from `1` onwards (`1`, `3`, `5`, ...).                                                                                          |
| 8       | ... numbers for which the remainder of the division by `15` is greater than `2` and less than `6`, starting from `48` onwards (`48`, `49`, `50`, ...).   |
| 9       | ... even numbers starting from `2` onwards (`2`, `4`, `6`, ...).                                                                                         |

Print the array to the standard output using the `for` loop.

### Reference (3.4)

To declare an array one should use a square brackets. Number in the square brackets means the size of the array:

```c
int numbers[10]; // Non-initialized array of 10 integer-typed values.
char symbols[3]; // Non-initialized array of 3 char-typed values.
```

Arrays can be created and initialized in one line using a braces:

```c
double values[3] = { 1.21, 1.44, 1.69 }; // Initialized array of 3 double-typed values.
```

This statement can be rewritten without mentioning the size of the array. In this case, the size is adjusted according to the number of elements initialized within the array:

```c
double values[] = { 1.21, 1.44, 1.69 }; // Initialized array of 3 double-typed values.
```

Note that the number in square brackets must be no less than the number of initial values. If it is larger, then uninitialized elements remain in the array.

To access array's element use `array[index]`:

```c
// Reading the third element of array _arr_ (because indexes are starting with 0)
int k = arr[2];

// Changing the first element of array _arr_:
arr[0] = 23;
```

Example, how to initialize an array:

```c
int i;
int arr[5];  

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++){
   arr[i] = 5;
}

// Array now contains:
// { 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 }

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++){
   arr[i] = i;
}

// Array now contains:
// { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++){
   arr[i] = (i + 1) * 2;
}

// Array now contains:
// { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }

```

How to check your array:

```c
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++){
   printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
```

## 3.5. The `break` statement

Declare an array of `10` integer-typed values. Initialize it either by integer constants in code or by reading data from a standard input. Using the `for` loop, try to find in the array a number ...

| Variant | Description                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... is divisible of `5`   |
| 2       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `18` is greater than `4` and less than `7`.   |
| 3       | ... ends with digit `3`  |
| 4       | ... is greater than `13` and less than `17`.                                                 |
| 5       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `9` equals `4`.                               |
| 6       | ... has at least `2` digits   |
| 7       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `6` equals `5`.                               |
| 8       | ... is greater than `40` and less than `46`.                                                 |
| 9       | ... for which the remainder of the division by `31` is greater than `16` and less than `21`. |

If the required number was found, display it. Otherwise, display a message saying that the number was not found.

Use the `break` statement to terminate `for` loop once the required number was found.

Sample output:

```
Please, input the array: 4 -3 5 8 -1 4 2 0 5 6
Required number: 8
```

### Reference (3.5)

It is sometimes convenient to be able to exit from a loop other than by testing at the top or bottom. The break statement provides an early exit from `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, just as from `switch`. A break causes the innermost enclosing loop or `switch` to be exited immediately.
